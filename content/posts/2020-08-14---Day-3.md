Today, watched The 'What' and 'Why' of functional programming. Its a pretty entertaining overview of functional programming. Junichero Swanson has a humorous and dry approach to describing functional programming and what makes it distinct from imperative (procedural) programming. 

He has a profound observation of the philosophical differences of the two paradigms which he compares to pre-Socratic schools of philosophy in regards to the mutability of data. In his words, imperative programming is in-line with Heraclitus, who wrote about fire. Fire is equivalent to change, in that everything is in a state of constant change. This is similar to imperative programming where variables can mutate and change. An example being in this for loop a is always changing:
```
let x = 1;
while(x < 3){
  x = x + 1
}

return x
```

In contrast, pre-Socratic philosopher Anaximander said that everything is in balance and constant. It is extratemporal, or happening outside of time.  This idea equates to immutability in functional programming.
