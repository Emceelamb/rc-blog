Over the weekend I've been working on Haskell exercises, and its been really hard! The syntax is really unfamiliar to me and thinking about these problems in a functional way/ recursively has been really stretching my mind. The biggest challenge is to think about problems without the use of indices. I never realized that I rely so much on mutation of data. I'm slowly slogging my way through the CIS194 exercises with a heavy reliance on youtube explanations, but at least I'm slowly beginning to understand the syntax of Haskell.

Today, I joined a session about Open Source Software. A couple people from more established open source projects such as Spoke and MatPlotLib talked about the open source space. They shared  stories about how they got into open source software and the reasons that bring people to OSS. 

After the session, I joined a Musical Programming session where people shared what kind of musical projects they worked on. A few projects that people shared were about synthesizing audio where they talked about different ways to synthesize audio, such as additive synthesis and programming audio in Haskell.

Afterwards, I joined a session on Python meta-classes.
